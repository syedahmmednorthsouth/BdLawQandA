Today the people of Bengal desire emancipation,\\nthe people of Bengal wish to live, the people of Bengal demand that their rights be\\nWhat wrong have we committed? Following the elections, the people of Bangladesh\\nentrusted me and the Awami League with the totality of their electoral support. It\\nwas our expectation that the Parliament would meet, there we would frame our\\nConstitution, that we would develop this land, that the people of this country would\\nachieve their economic, political and cultural freedom. But it is a matter of grief that\\ntoday we are constrained to say in all sadness that the history of the past twenty\\nthree years has been the history of a persecution of the people of Bengal, a history of\\nthe blood of the people of Bengal. This history of the past twenty three years has\\nbeen one of the agonising cries of men and women.\\nThe history of Bengal has been a history where the people of this land have made\\ncrimson the streets and highways of this land with their blood. We gave blood in\\n1952; in 1954, we won the elections and yet were not permitted to exercise power.\\nIn 1958, Ayub Khan imposed Martial Law and kept the nation in a state of slavery for\\nten long years.

When Yahya Khan took over once\\nAyub Khan fell in the fury of the movement of 1969, he promised that he would give\\nus a Constitution, give us democracy. We put our faith on him. And then history\\nmoved a long way, the elections took place. I have met President Yahya Khan. I\\nappealed to him, not just as the majority leader in Bengal but also as the majority\\nleader in Pakistan, to convene the National Assembly on 15 February. He did not pay\\nheed to my appeal. He paid heed to Mr. Bhutto. And he said that the assembly would\\nbe convened in the first week that we would discuss matters in the Assembly. I even\\nwent to the extent of suggesting that despite our being in a majority, if anyone\\nproposes anything that is legitimate and right, we would accept his proposal.\\nMr. Bhutto came here. He held negotiations with us, and when he left, he said that\\nthe door to talk had not closed, that more discussions would take place. After that, I\\nspoke to other political leaders. I told them to join me in deliberations so that we\\ncould give shape to a Constitution for the country. But Mr. Bhutto said that if\\nmembers elected from West Pakistan came here, the Assembly would turn into a\\nslaughter house, an abattoir. He warned that anyone who went to the Assembly\\nwould end up losing his life. He issued dire warnings of closing down all the shop\\nfrom Peshawar to Karachi if the Assembly Session went ahead. I said that the\\nAssembly Session would go ahead.

Thirty five members came here\\nfrom West Pakistan. And suddenly the Assembly was put off. The blame was placed\\nsquarely on the people of Bengal, the blame was put at my door. Once the Assembly\\nmeeting was postponed, the people of this land decided to put up resistance to the\\nI enjoined upon them to observe a peaceful general strike. I instructed them to close\\ndown all factories and industrial installations. The people responded positively to my\\ndirectives. Through sheer spontaneity they emerged on to the streets. They were\\ndetermined to pursue their struggle through peaceful means.\\nWhat have we attained? The weapons we have bought with our money to defend the\\ncountry against foreign aggression are being used against the poor and\\ndown-trodden of my country today. It is their hearts the bullets pierce today. We are\\nthe majority in Pakistan. Whenever we Bengalis have attempted to ascend to the\\nheights of power, they have swooped upon us.\\nI have spoken to him over telephone. I told him, Mr. Yahya Khan, you are the\\nPresident of Pakistan. Come, be witness to the inhuman manner in which the people\\nof my Bengal are being murdered, to the way in which the mothers of my land are\\nbeing deprived of their sons.\" I told him, \"come, see and dispense justice\". But he\\nconstruously said that I had agreed to participate in a Round Table Conference to be\\nheld on 10 March. I have already said a long time ago, what RTC? With whom do I sit\\ndown to talk? Do I fraternise with those have taken the blood of my people? All of a\\nsudden, without discussing matters with me and after a secret meeting lasting five\\nhours, he has delivered a speech in which he has placed all responsibility for the\\nimpasse on me, on the people of Bengal.\\nThey have called the Assembly for the twenty-fifth. The marks of blood have not yet\\ndried up. I said on the tenth that Mujibur Rahman would not walk across that blood\\nto take part in a Round Table Conference. You have called the Assembly. But my\\ndemands must be met first. Martial Law must be withdrawn. All military personnel\\nmust be taken back to the barracks. An inquiry must be conducted into the manner in\\nwhich the killings have been caused. And power must be transferred to the elected\\nrepresentatives of the people. And only then shall we consider the question of\\nwhether or not to sit in the National Assembly. Prior to the fulfilment of our\\ndemands, we cannot take part in the Assembly.\\nI do not desire the office of Prime Minister. I wish to see the rights of the people of\\nthis country established. Let me make it clear, without ambiguity, that beginning\\ntoday, in Bangladesh, all courts, magistracies, government offices and educational\\ninstitutions will remain closed for an indefinite period. In order that the poor do not\\nsuffer, in order that my people do not go through pain, all other activities will\\ncontinue, will not come within the ambit of the general strike from tomorrow.\\nRickshaws, horse carriages, trains and river vessels will ply. The Supreme Court, High\\nCourt, Judge\\'s Court, semi-government offices, WAPDA,-nothing will work.\\nEmployees will collect their salaries on the twenty-eighth.

Today the people of Bengal desire emancipation,\\nthe people of Bengal wish to live, the people of Bengal demand that their rights be\\nWhat wrong have we committed? Following the elections, the people of Bangladesh\\nentrusted me and the Awami League with the totality of their electoral support. It\\nwas our expectation that the Parliament would meet, there we would frame our\\nConstitution, that we would develop this land, that the people of this country would\\nachieve their economic, political and cultural freedom. But it is a matter of grief that\\ntoday we are constrained to say in all sadness that the history of the past twenty\\nthree years has been the history of a persecution of the people of Bengal, a history of\\nthe blood of the people of Bengal. This history of the past twenty three years has\\nbeen one of the agonising cries of men and women.\\nThe history of Bengal has been a history where the people of this land have made\\ncrimson the streets and highways of this land with their blood. We gave blood in\\n1952; in 1954, we won the elections and yet were not permitted to exercise power.\\nIn 1958, Ayub Khan imposed Martial Law and kept the nation in a state of slavery for\\nten long years.

When Yahya Khan took over once\\nAyub Khan fell in the fury of the movement of 1969, he promised that he would give\\nus a Constitution, give us democracy. We put our faith on him. And then history\\nmoved a long way, the elections took place. I have met President Yahya Khan. I\\nappealed to him, not just as the majority leader in Bengal but also as the majority\\nleader in Pakistan, to convene the National Assembly on 15 February. He did not pay\\nheed to my appeal. He paid heed to Mr. Bhutto. And he said that the assembly would\\nbe convened in the first week that we would discuss matters in the Assembly. I even\\nwent to the extent of suggesting that despite our being in a majority, if anyone\\nproposes anything that is legitimate and right, we would accept his proposal.\\nMr. Bhutto came here. He held negotiations with us, and when he left, he said that\\nthe door to talk had not closed, that more discussions would take place. After that, I\\nspoke to other political leaders. I told them to join me in deliberations so that we\\ncould give shape to a Constitution for the country. But Mr. Bhutto said that if\\nmembers elected from West Pakistan came here, the Assembly would turn into a\\nslaughter house, an abattoir. He warned that anyone who went to the Assembly\\nwould end up losing his life. He issued dire warnings of closing down all the shop\\nfrom Peshawar to Karachi if the Assembly Session went ahead. I said that the\\nAssembly Session would go ahead.

Thirty five members came here\\nfrom West Pakistan. And suddenly the Assembly was put off. The blame was placed\\nsquarely on the people of Bengal, the blame was put at my door. Once the Assembly\\nmeeting was postponed, the people of this land decided to put up resistance to the\\nI enjoined upon them to observe a peaceful general strike. I instructed them to close\\ndown all factories and industrial installations. The people responded positively to my\\ndirectives. Through sheer spontaneity they emerged on to the streets. They were\\ndetermined to pursue their struggle through peaceful means.\\nWhat have we attained? The weapons we have bought with our money to defend the\\ncountry against foreign aggression are being used against the poor and\\ndown-trodden of my country today. It is their hearts the bullets pierce today. We are\\nthe majority in Pakistan. Whenever we Bengalis have attempted to ascend to the\\nheights of power, they have swooped upon us.\\nI have spoken to him over telephone. I told him, Mr. Yahya Khan, you are the\\nPresident of Pakistan. Come, be witness to the inhuman manner in which the people\\nof my Bengal are being murdered, to the way in which the mothers of my land are\\nbeing deprived of their sons.\" I told him, \"come, see and dispense justice\". But he\\nconstruously said that I had agreed to participate in a Round Table Conference to be\\nheld on 10 March. I have already said a long time ago, what RTC? With whom do I sit\\ndown to talk? Do I fraternise with those have taken the blood of my people? All of a\\nsudden, without discussing matters with me and after a secret meeting lasting five\\nhours, he has delivered a speech in which he has placed all responsibility for the\\nimpasse on me, on the people of Bengal.\\nThey have called the Assembly for the twenty-fifth. The marks of blood have not yet\\ndried up. I said on the tenth that Mujibur Rahman would not walk across that blood\\nto take part in a Round Table Conference. You have called the Assembly. But my\\ndemands must be met first. Martial Law must be withdrawn. All military personnel\\nmust be taken back to the barracks. An inquiry must be conducted into the manner in\\nwhich the killings have been caused. And power must be transferred to the elected\\nrepresentatives of the people. And only then shall we consider the question of\\nwhether or not to sit in the National Assembly. Prior to the fulfilment of our\\ndemands, we cannot take part in the Assembly.\\nI do not desire the office of Prime Minister. I wish to see the rights of the people of\\nthis country established. Let me make it clear, without ambiguity, that beginning\\ntoday, in Bangladesh, all courts, magistracies, government offices and educational\\ninstitutions will remain closed for an indefinite period. In order that the poor do not\\nsuffer, in order that my people do not go through pain, all other activities will\\ncontinue, will not come within the ambit of the general strike from tomorrow.\\nRickshaws, horse carriages, trains and river vessels will ply. The Supreme Court, High\\nCourt, Judge\\'s Court, semi-government offices, WAPDA,-nothing will work.\\nEmployees will collect their salaries on the twenty-eighth.

You are aware of\\neverything and know all. We have tried with our lives. And yet the sadness remains\\nthat today, in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Rangpur the streets are\\nsoaked in the blood of my brothers. Today the people of Bengal desire emancipation,\\nthe people of Bengal wish to live, the people of Bengal demand that their rights be\\nWhat wrong have we committed? Following the elections, the people of Bangladesh\\nentrusted me and the Awami League with the totality of their electoral support. It\\nwas our expectation that the Parliament would meet, there we would frame our\\nConstitution, that we would develop this land, that the people of this country would\\nachieve their economic, political and cultural freedom. But it is a matter of grief that\\ntoday we are constrained to say in all sadness that the history of the past twenty\\nthree years has been the history of a persecution of the people of Bengal, a history of\\nthe blood of the people of Bengal. This history of the past twenty three years has\\nbeen one of the agonising cries of men and women.\\nThe history of Bengal has been a history where the people of this land have made\\ncrimson the streets and highways of this land with their blood. We gave blood in\\n1952; in 1954, we won the elections and yet were not permitted to exercise power.\\nIn 1958, Ayub Khan imposed Martial Law and kept the nation in a state of slavery for\\nten long years. On 7 June 1966, as they rose in support of the Six-Point movement,\\nthe sons of my land were mown down in gunfire. When Yahya Khan took over once\\nAyub Khan fell in the fury of the movement of 1969, he promised that he would give\\nus a Constitution, give us democracy. We put our faith on him. And then history\\nmoved a long way, the elections took place. I have met President Yahya Khan. I\\nappealed to him, not just as the majority leader in Bengal but also as the majority\\nleader in Pakistan, to convene the National Assembly on 15 February. He did not pay\\nheed to my appeal. He paid heed to Mr. Bhutto. And he said that the assembly would\\nbe convened in the first week that we would discuss matters in the Assembly. I even\\nwent to the extent of suggesting that despite our being in a majority, if anyone\\nproposes anything that is legitimate and right, we would accept his proposal.\\nMr. Bhutto came here. He held negotiations with us, and when he left, he said that\\nthe door to talk had not closed, that more discussions would take place. After that, I\\nspoke to other political leaders. I told them to join me in deliberations so that we\\ncould give shape to a Constitution for the country. But Mr. Bhutto said that if\\nmembers elected from West Pakistan came here, the Assembly would turn into a\\nslaughter house, an abattoir. He warned that anyone who went to the Assembly\\nwould end up losing his life. He issued dire warnings of closing down all the shop\\nfrom Peshawar to Karachi if the Assembly Session went ahead. I said that the\\nAssembly Session would go ahead. And then, suddenly, on the first of March the\\nPDF generated: 26 Aug 2021, 16:18\\nBangladesh 1972 (reinst. 1986, rev. 2014)\\nAssembly Session was put off. Mr. Yahya Khan, in exercise of his powers as\\npresident, had called the National Assembly into Session; and I had said that I would\\ngo to the Assembly. Mr. Bhutto said he would not go. Thirty five members came here\\nfrom West Pakistan. And suddenly the Assembly was put off. The blame was placed\\nsquarely on the people of Bengal, the blame was put at my door. Once the Assembly\\nmeeting was postponed, the people of this land decided to put up resistance to the\\nI enjoined upon them to observe a peaceful general strike. I instructed them to close\\ndown all factories and industrial installations. The people responded positively to my\\ndirectives. Through sheer spontaneity they emerged on to the streets. They were\\ndetermined to pursue their struggle through peaceful means.\\nWhat have we attained? The weapons we have bought with our money to defend the\\ncountry against foreign aggression are being used against the poor and\\ndown-trodden of my country today. It is their hearts the bullets pierce today. We are\\nthe majority in Pakistan. Whenever we Bengalis have attempted to ascend to the\\nheights of power, they have swooped upon us.\\nI have spoken to him over telephone. I told him, Mr. Yahya Khan, you are the\\nPresident of Pakistan. Come, be witness to the inhuman manner in which the people\\nof my Bengal are being murdered, to the way in which the mothers of my land are\\nbeing deprived of their sons.\" I told him, \"come, see and dispense justice\". But he\\nconstruously said that I had agreed to participate in a Round Table Conference to be\\nheld on 10 March. I have already said a long time ago, what RTC? With whom do I sit\\ndown to talk? Do I fraternise with those have taken the blood of my people? All of a\\nsudden, without discussing matters with me and after a secret meeting lasting five\\nhours, he has delivered a speech in which he has placed all responsibility for the\\nimpasse on me, on the people of Bengal.\\nThey have called the Assembly for the twenty-fifth. The marks of blood have not yet\\ndried up. I said on the tenth that Mujibur Rahman would not walk across that blood\\nto take part in a Round Table Conference. You have called the Assembly. But my\\ndemands must be met first. Martial Law must be withdrawn. All military personnel\\nmust be taken back to the barracks. An inquiry must be conducted into the manner in\\nwhich the killings have been caused. And power must be transferred to the elected\\nrepresentatives of the people. And only then shall we consider the question of\\nwhether or not to sit in the National Assembly. Prior to the fulfilment of our\\ndemands, we cannot take part in the Assembly.\\nI do not desire the office of Prime Minister. I wish to see the rights of the people of\\nthis country established. Let me make it clear, without ambiguity, that beginning\\ntoday, in Bangladesh, all courts, magistracies, government offices and educational\\ninstitutions will remain closed for an indefinite period. In order that the poor do not\\nsuffer, in order that my people do not go through pain, all other activities will\\ncontinue, will not come within the ambit of the general strike from tomorrow.\\nRickshaws, horse carriages, trains and river vessels will ply. The Supreme Court, High\\nCourt, Judge\\'s Court, semi-government offices, WAPDA,-nothing will work.\\nEmployees will collect their salaries on the twenty-eighth. But if the salaries are not\\npaid, if another bullet is fired, if any more of the people are murdered, it is my\\ndirective to all of you: turn every house into a fortress, resist the enemy with\\neverything you have. And for the sake of life, even if I am not around to guide you,\\ndirect you, close off all roads and pathways.\\nWe will strive them into submission. We will submerge them in water. You are our\\nbrothers. Return to your barracks and no harm will come to you. But do not try to\\npour bullets into my heart again. You cannot keep seventy five million people in\\nbondage.
